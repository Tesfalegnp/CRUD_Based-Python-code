# CRUD Base App in Python

This is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built using Python. It serves as a basic template for handling database operations and can be easily extended to integrate with different databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) or APIs.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database.
- **Read**: Fetch records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- SQLite (for simplicity, but can be replaced with other databases)
- SQLAlchemy (optional ORM for better handling of database queries)
- Flask (optional, if you want to turn it into a web app)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crud-base-app-python.git
